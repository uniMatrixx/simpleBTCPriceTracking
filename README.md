#Simple BTC price tracking with coindesk API

This is really basic api app for tracking btc price with coindesk api. You can develop your apps with this .
Firstly , You should import your modules .For example requests for api , time , smtplib for send a mail.
And after that you can write functions , with the help of this habit of mine you can really manage your project easliy. When ever you want you can modify your code.
I used live.com for sending a mail , you can change this. 

Good Luck ! =)
